    <h1>this is the coolest website ever created on the internet in existence</h1>
    <h2>i know i'm talented u don't need to be so jealous like omg</h2>

    <p>jim, u rly need to understand that all people on this earth have different strengths and weaknesses. and unfortunately, yours isn't programming. it's ok to not be good at programming. if everyone was good at all the same things, there would be no progress and it would be so boring. please please just stop being a hating ass bitch. it makes u look so pathetic and u really need a life if ur that obsessed with telling me i can't do things i like.</p>

    <p>on the bright side, u mentioned u do freelance work and blogging. i'm really proud u were able to accomplish those things! it shows that u do have a base level of intelligence and are not completely a waste of life and a human brain. i would encourage u to pursue being employed by a development firm like I am interested in accomplishing. u can make a lot of money working for a firm! i really hope u don't give up on yourself and that u move out of your mom's basement. it will be a big step for u, but i think u can do it (:</p>

    <p>i hope that your jealous h8ing ass bitchness has subsided and u can see now that i am in fact a website developer, and soon i will be a software/OS system developer too.</p>
